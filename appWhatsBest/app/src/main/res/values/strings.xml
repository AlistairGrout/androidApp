    <string name="text_about">"What's Best?!" is a fun and simple application I made for school.
    It is constantly improving and I\'m doing my best to add interesting features to it.
    I welcome any constructive criticism you might have. Please note that I won\'t be taking down
    weird propositions you might find in the game. Some are fun, some are not, but in the end it\'s my work
    and I want to let it have cranky stuff in it.
    My name is Ali G (yeaaah like the infamous ALI G.) and I develop applications under a label name I just made up, Sparkling Kitten.</string>
